I plan to build a website for an improv comedy show that I am in called Dragons and Dungeons.

It will feature an about page, a character page and a page with upcoming shows as well as contact information. 

It will also have a Python generated text-based adventure game. 

Will feature the shows podcast on the site

A blog about shows, the podcast and more.
